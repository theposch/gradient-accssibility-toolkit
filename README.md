# Gradient Accessibility Checker

A modern, interactive toolkit for designing, analyzing, and optimizing CSS gradients for accessible text overlays. Built with React, it provides real-time contrast analysis, smart suggestions, and a rich editing experience for designers and developers.

## Features

- **Visual Gradient Editor:** UI for creating and editing multi-stop CSS gradients.
- **Text Overlay & Typography:** Add, style, and align text over gradients. Upload custom fonts and adjust typography.
- **Contrast Analysis:** Real-time WCAG 2.2 contrast checking across the entire gradient, with pass/fail visualization.
- **Smart Suggestions:**
  - Suggests accessible text colors for your gradient.
  - Suggests gradient tweaks to improve contrast with your chosen text color.
- **Presets & Customization:** Start from beautiful presets or design your own.
- **Undo/Redo:** Full history support for gradient and text color changes.
- **Save & Load:** Save your favorite gradient+text combos locally for reuse.
- **Copy CSS:** One-click copy of the current gradient and text color CSS.

## Technical Architecture

- **React Frontend:**
  - Main entry: `src/pages/App.tsx` orchestrates state, UI, and logic.
  - **Components:**
    - `GradientEditor`: Visual editing of gradient stops, angles, and presets.
    - `GradientCanvas`: Renders the gradient and overlays contrast analysis.
    - `TextSettings`: Controls for text, color, alignment, and font.
    - `ContrastAnalysisPanel`, `SavedDrawer`, `Tooltip`, etc.
  - **Engines:**
    - `ContrastEngine`: Samples the gradient, computes per-pixel contrast ratios, and classifies regions as pass/fail (AA/AAA).
    - `SuggestionEngine`: Suggests accessible text colors and gradient modifications using color science (culori, gradient-parser).
  - **Hooks:**
    - `useFontManager`: Handles custom font uploads, selection, and typography settings.
    - `useGradientHistory`: Manages undo/redo stacks for gradient and text color.
  - **Utilities:**
    - `storage.ts`: Persists saved gradients in localStorage.
    - `constants/`: Preset gradients and font lists.

## How It Works (Technical Flow)

1. **Editing:**
   - User edits the gradient visually or via presets.
   - User customizes text overlay, color, font, and alignment.
2. **Contrast Analysis:**
   - The app samples the gradient (using an offscreen canvas) and computes the contrast ratio between each sampled color and the text color.
   - Results are visualized as overlays (green/yellow/red for AAA/AA/fail) and summarized numerically.
3. **Suggestions:**
   - Suggests text colors that maximize contrast with the current gradient.
   - Suggests gradient tweaks (lighten/darken stops) to improve contrast with the chosen text color.
4. **Persistence:**
   - Users can save up to 50 gradient+text combos locally.
   - Undo/redo is managed via a custom hook tracking history entries.
5. **Font Management:**
   - Users can upload custom fonts (via FontFace API) and adjust typography for both headline and paragraph text.
